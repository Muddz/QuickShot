An Android library that saves any `View`, `SurfaceView` or `Bitmap` as an image in `JPG`,`PNG` or `.nomedia`.
The library works on a asynchronous thread and handles errors and memory for you. 

### Features
- Support for Android API 29+ and scoped storage
- Save in `JPG`,`PNG` or `.nomedia`.
- Save `Bitmap`, `View` or `SurfaceView` objects as images
- Set a path and filename for your captures or resort to auto defaults 
- Asynchronous saving


## Example of simplest usage with defaults
<i>You can use a simple one-liner and let QuickShot set default values like in the following example:</i>

Filename defaults to a timestamp.   
Path defaults to `/Pictures` in internal storage.  
Image format defaults to `.JPG`

```java
   QuickShot.of(view).setResultListener(this).save();
```

## Example of a detailed usage
```java
    QuickShot.of(view).setResultListener(this)
                      .enableLogging()
                      .setFilename("QuickShot")
                      .setPath("MyApp")
                      .toPNG()
                      .save();
```
